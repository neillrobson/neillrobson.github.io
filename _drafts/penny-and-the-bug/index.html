<p>Early one morning, Peter walked across the office to his team’s standup meeting.</p>
<p>There in the conference room sat Betty, a backend engineer and Peter’s friend.
“Late as usual,” she quipped with a smirk.</p>
<p>Just then Frank the frontend engineer came rushing in. He was glad that Peter
had not closed the door and immediately pulled up some new wireframes to
discuss with the team.</p>
<p>Tiring of the discussion, the Betty interrupted Frank’s monologue, pulled up the
sprint board, and shrugged her shoulders.  “What kind of engineer are you if you
can’t sort an array?” said she.</p>
<p>To this Frank replied, “What kind of an engineer are you if you can’t center a
div?” and threw his feet up on the table.</p>
<p>They argued and argued, Frank bemoaning poor UX and Betty chattering about code
bloat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something caught Peter’s attention. He noticed Quinn, the QA engineer,
had logged in to the standup meeting remotely.</p>
<p>Quinn thought, “Listen to them argue. They haven’t even written their unit
tests yet.” Stealthily, her cursor began dragging their cards from the testing
column into development.</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s our sprint goal!” shouted Peter. Betty flew into a rant about
testing being a cargo cult, while Frank complained that the work isn’t even
customer-facing.</p>
<p>Quinn muted her Zoom and thought, “Is it worth arguing with them? It’ll be lunch
by the time they come to their senses.”</p>
<p>Just then, their manager Maggie walked in. She was upset because Peter was just
sitting around at standup.</p>
<p>“You’re distracting the team, Peter! What if a sev1 shows up and they miss it?
How would you explain yourself?”</p>
<p>But Peter paid no attention to his manager’s words. Even interns like him know
there’s more to the job than programming.</p>
<p>But Maggie walked Peter out of the room, closed the door, and led him to his
desk.</p>
<p>No sooner had Peter gone, than an ominous message showed up in the major
incidents Slack channel–a denial of service attack.</p>
<hr>
<p>In a twinkling, Quinn logged off Zoom and set his Slack status to “focusing: do not disturb.”</p>
<p>Frank exclaimed, “I bet it’s our embedded iframe widget!” and feverishly wrote a regular expression to block third-party sources.</p>
<p>But no matter what Frank pushed to production, the DOS queries kept coming.</p>
<p>The server load was greater and greater, slowing the frontend service to a crawl.</p>
<p>The load was too great, and in a flash, the frontend service was down.</p>
<p>Frank left the office in his humiliation. Both Betty and Quinn were brainstorming with the team on Slack… though never talking directly to each other.</p>
<p>They imagined the botnet prowling around the network, looking for an opening to wreak further havoc.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Peter, without the slightest fear, watched the incidents Slack channel and pondered all that was going on.</p>
