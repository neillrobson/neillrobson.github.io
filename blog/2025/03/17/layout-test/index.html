</div><p>NEW YORK – Text set in all caps gets converted to small-caps by default. This means that acronyms like BBC don’t stand out relative to the rest of the text. Acronyms even work with accents like ÀÊØ. A possessive <a href="/">acronym</a> like CNN’s opinion works as well. What about the FCC! The so called (BBC). Also I automatically convert three dots to an ellipsis… « Hello » there should have non-breaking spaces between the punctuation and the word…</p>
<p>So how does inline/block $$\LaTeX$$ work?
Can I say that, if $$n \geq 3$$, then the problem is intractable?</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n^2 + n}{2}
$$</p>
<p>Accents all work perfectly in Georgia. Al­brecht Dürer, François Truf­faut, Plácido Domingo should all render appropriately. Cause célèbre, piña co­lada, Göt­ter­däm­merung straße all work too. Links also are improved: note how the <a href="/">descenders get cleared</a> from the underline stroke. Composing content for the web is complicated because the designer has no control over the dimensions of the screen on which the content will be viewed?</p>
<p>“Hanging quotes and smart quotes.” Blot will convert primes and basic quotes automatically. All you have to do is type using primes (') and inch marks (&quot;) and “everything” looks lovely. “Better than a 65’6” whale.&quot; – Captain Ahab. “It’s my ‘#1’ choice!” – 12&quot; Foam Finger from '93. You can put acronyms and quotes safely inside code blocks too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">foo(&quot;bar&quot;); // Won't have smart quotes or auto ACR...

<p>While I was in the mood for XML I added a site map to each blog and a text file so Google can index your posts easily. Does out text actually get struck out? Looks like it does. Hello is a designer and writer. Recent work has touched on a range of topics, including the relationship of movement and interaction, the history of visual identity and branding in the arts, and the future of the museum in the digital age. His essay on the rise of graphic design MFA programs, “School Days” was dope?</p>

</div><p>You can pass an options object to influence the type of color it produces. The options object accepts the following properties. Controls the hue of the generated color. You can pass a string representing a color name: <code>red</code>, <code>orange</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>purple</code>, <code>pink</code> and <code>monochrome</code> are currently supported.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Returns a hex code for an attractive color
randomColor();

// Returns an array of ten green colors
randomColor({
  count: 10,
  hue: &quot;green&quot;,
});

// Returns a hex code for a light blue
randomColor({
  luminosity: &quot;dark&quot;,
  hue: &quot;blue&quot;,
});
</code></pre>
<h3>To do</h3>
<p><em>It might be a good idea to consider using other color models.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When returning an array of multiple colors, try to make each color as distinct as possible. Make sure each color is distinct to its neighbours.</li>
<li>Improve attractive dark color generation, currently they’re a touch murky.</li>
<li>Improve the color dictionary
<ul>
<li>definition of hue values and attractive luminosity bounds</li>
<li>think about how to store hue aliases (e.g. fuschia) or subranges (e.g teal)</li>
<li>think about making a little point and click tool for defining your own luminosity bounds and customizing the color dictionary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think about using and returning seeds.</li>
<li>Think about adding feature to return complementary &amp; contrasting colors, as well as color triads, tetrads etc. Other libraries might already do this better though.</li>
<li>Think about adding a scheme options which would return a dominant color, as well as secondary, tertiary color and primary and secondary text colors. This might be a bad idea.</li>
