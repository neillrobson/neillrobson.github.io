I remember when you broke prod
the first time
Eating all the RAM up like a hog
But, like
We hadn't added features for so long
When you said you're out of space (what?)

Then you come around again and say
"maybe
the data binding's garbage anyway
trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
You say,
"New version!" we update, you crash and, we panic

Oooh
We rolled back a deploy last night, but
Oooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever using Angular
We are never ever ever using Angular
Bindings call directives call decrepit factories
No we are never ever ever ever using Angular

Like, ever

I'm gonna miss you ruining my site
parsing
Trojans hacked together by some guy
farming
every insecurity they find
In your
binding strategy that's much safer than mine

Oooh
You leaked our session keys tonight, and
Oooh
This time, I'm telling you I'm telling you

We are never ever ever using Angular
We are never ever ever using Angular
Bindings call directives call decrepit factories
No we are never ever ever ever using Angular
