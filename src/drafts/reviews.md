## Past Lives

_2025 June ??_

Past Lives is a touching film.
It strikes a careful balance between the pragmatic and fantastic,
inspiring the audience while remaining grounded in reality.

I personally found the plot refreshing in the realm of romance films.
The focus of the plot is not on lovers, but friends:
not on chemistry, but culture and seasons of life.
That isn't to say the movie is purely academic, lacking in emotion either.
I found myself deeply engaged with the characters' choices,
empathizing with both sides of arguments and decisions, however irrational.

The cinematography is rock-solid as well.
Fans of the long shot will find a handful of gems in this film
(without feeling beaten over the head with lugubrious art-house pans).
Technology is thoughtfully chosen to represent the various decades of the story,
evoking nostalgia in the audience without anachronistic cliches.

Viewers looking for a comfortable yet thought-provoking watch will appreciate this film!
