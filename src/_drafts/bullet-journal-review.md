Sometime around the beginning of the year in 2016, I was looking for a new way to organize my sundry appointments, activities, and thoughts. Traditional agendas were nice, but I often found myself cramming unrelated notes and ideas into margins and timesheets because there was no place for brainstorming. For larger thoughts, I had a bad habit of pulling out loose-leaf paper and just spilling out a stream-of-consciousness manifesto to get the idea in writing, then filing it away in some obscure location, never to be found again.
