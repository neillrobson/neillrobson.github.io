</div>
<p><em>2025 July 14</em></p>
<p>5 stars</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Huxley was ahead of his time writing this book.</p>
<p>Many dystopian novels of the past few decades revel in the horror
that their inhabitants experience.
Such spectacle can be moving to readers,
but I also find it can sometimes be desensitizing:
we read those horrors as an escape, and feel comfort that our lives
“aren’t nearly that bad.”</p>
<p>Brave New World is unique in that, from the outset,
this society is a dystopia that works, from end to end.
People are happy.
And, though some of the specifics are anachronistic to the 21st century reader,
the means of the society’s happiness are shockingly similar
to many of the technologies we know and love today.
Much of my childhood was literally spent dreaming of the luxuries
the characters of the book take for granted, just as we do today.</p>
<p>In the maudlin words of Jonathan Coulton,</p>
<p>It’s gonna be the future soon
I won’t always be this way
When the things that make me weak and strange
Get engineered away</p>
<p>It all sounds so good to my younger self—yet Brave New World
is a slap in the face reminding me of what we all are sacrificing
for “mere pleasure.”
And the book conveys this message without fire or brimstone:
the insulation that the characters experience from punishment
is somehow even more pungent and applicable to our privileged lives today.</p>
<p>As a fair warning:
this book does contain the implication of extensive sexual activity.
Normally such content would bother me.
However, Huxley does a superb job of keeping truly explicit description
off of the page, while still conveying the information necessary to forward the plot.</p>

<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="#memento"></a><h2 id="memento">Memento</h2>
</div>
<p><em>2025 July 12</em></p>
<p>4.5 stars</p>
<p>As a Nolan fan, it’s no wonder that I love this film.
I would venture to say that Memento is one of his best works, in fact:
it has a temprance and moderation about it that his more recent films lack.</p>
<p>Like most Nolan films, the plot is presented in a cryptic, non-linear manner.
However, the visual cues that he uses to hint at the meaning of the presentation
are satisfyingly blunt:
the viewer need not resort to half-hour conspiracy videos on YouTube to make
heads or tails of the events.</p>
<p>Similarly, the use of stunts and special effects is also quite reserved.
Spectacle simply wasn’t necessary to convey the essential elements of the story,
and I think the film is made better by the lack of extraneous sparkle.
The acting shines through in a refreshing way,
and I found the characters all the more relatable due to the greater focus
I was able to put on their words and actions (as opposed to special effects).</p>
<p>If you enjoy mysteries and thrillers,
but find sagas like Tenet or Interstellar prolix and inscrutable,
Memento may just be the film you’re looking for!</p>

<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="#girls%E2%80%99-state"></a><h2 id="girls%E2%80%99-state">Girls’ State</h2>
</div>
<p><em>2025 July 3</em></p>
<p>4 stars</p>
<p>As an alum of Boys’ State, and a amateur critic of the program,
I found this documentary to be a fascinating and comprehensive snapshot
of the “other side of the fence.”</p>
<p>A central takeaway of my time in the program was the discrepancy
between the noble intentions of democratic processes,
and the actual strained interactions between young people
coming from vastly different backgrounds and cultures.
We easily forget how much diversity is found within even the smallest states
of America, and the wide-ranging needs and opinions of the various people groups within.
Politics easily devolves into popularity contests and ad-hominem pleas,
regardless of the maturity or merit of the politicians.</p>
<p>A24 also released a documentary covering Boys’ State,
which I have watched previously and also highly recommend.
This sibling film captures many of the same themes,
and also illuminates sobering differences between the experiences of
young women (as opposed to young men) coerced into week-long single-ed
political simulations.</p>
<p>The documentors chose several participants to follow throughout the week,
and they did an excellent job highlighting how their stories intertwined
without scripting or forcing interactions.
I was moved by the experiences shown,
in large part due to my own history with the program,
but also due to the thoughtful talent of the filmmakers.</p>
<p>Anyone looking for both pragmatic and hopeful insight into the next generation
of young politicians should definitely give this documentary a watch!</p>

<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="#past-lives"></a><h2 id="past-lives">Past Lives</h2>
</div>
<p><em>2025 June ??</em></p>
<p>4 stars</p>
<p>Past Lives is a touching film.
It strikes a careful balance between the pragmatic and fantastic,
inspiring the audience while remaining grounded in reality.</p>
<p>I personally found the plot refreshing in the realm of romance films.
The focus of the plot is not on lovers, but friends:
not on chemistry, but culture and seasons of life.
That isn’t to say the movie is purely academic, lacking in emotion either.
I found myself deeply engaged with the characters’ choices,
empathizing with both sides of arguments and decisions, however irrational.</p>
<p>The cinematography is rock-solid as well.
Fans of the long shot will find a handful of gems in this film
(without feeling beaten over the head with lugubrious art-house pans).
Technology is thoughtfully chosen to represent the various decades of the story,
evoking nostalgia in the audience without anachronistic cliches.</p>
<p>Viewers looking for a comfortable yet thought-provoking watch will appreciate this film!</p>
